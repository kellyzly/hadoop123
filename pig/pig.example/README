#how to debug pig in spark local mode?
pig is launched by hadoop, so export pig_suspend="n" and export pig_suspend="y" in $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop
```js

 elif [ "$COMMAND" = "jar" ] ; then
 if [ "$pig_suspend" == "y" ];then
   HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=9999"
  fi  
```
